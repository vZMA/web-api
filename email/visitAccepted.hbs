		Hello {{name}}, <br /><br />
		On behalf of the Miami vARTCC, we're happy to have you join our team! By choosing ZMA, you have selected to join a very busy region on VATSIM and one that prides itself always striving for excellence.  <br /><br />First, please login on ZMA's website, easily located at www.zmaartcc.net! This is required! If you encounter an issue with this please email datm@zmaartcc.net with your CID and the issue you are encountering. <br /><br />All new controllers to our community should read through the entire Training Department section on the Miami website. This will help familiarize yourself with the Miami vARTCC website, such as our Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Letters of Agreement (LOA). Please start now to be prepared to complete the Miami Basic SOP exam, a requirement to begin training! The SOP has already been assigned. Check the Academy website in the ZMA course for it. <br /><br />We strongly suggest visiting Training Frequently Asked Questions to help get started on your journey! Please take time to read the provided links and other supplemental information to assist in your online ATC career with Miami. Our goal is to help everyone have the best experience possible while participating in this pastime. This means independent work is an absolute necessity. The value of your own reading of materials, your own observations of other controllers and practice cannot be overstated. For our training process please see this notice: https://zma-web.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/downloads/1643151058481-ZMA%20N3%20-%20Implementation%20of%20Training%20Queue.pdf. It outlines how we currently go about scheduling training. <br /><br />Lastly, we'd love to have you join our ZMA Community Discord. It is not our primary form of voice communication, but we use it very frequently for text communication with our members. I strongly encourage you to join, it'll be the easiest way to ask questions of the community and get to know people. Join using this link: https://discord.gg/HpFxxn8. Our primary form of voice communication comes in the form of our TS3 Server, to join that download and install Teamspeak3 and click this link to connect. To save a Teamspeak bookmark, the server address is teamspeak.zmaartcc.net and the password is ILoveZMA (sic).<br /><br />we are looking forward to working with you and hope you will find your experience, as a ZMA controller, to be an enjoyable one. Please let us know if you have any questions and sign into our teamspeak to meet us and join the community!<br /><br />On behalf of our entire team, we look forward to seeing you!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />The ZMA Staff Team<br /><br /><p style="font-style: italic; font-size: .7rem;">P.S.
